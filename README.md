## Quick start
1. NO NEED TO DEAL WITH GITHUB, JUST CLICK THIS LINK TO DOWNLOAD ALL WORKSHOP R SCRIPTS: https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/mridulkthomas/experimental-design-limnoseries-workshop/tree/65aabd930e98b83582ac9e2cc90f3e87f9fb4330/R (or clone if you want to use Git).
2. Scripts live in `R/` and are numbered `01_...R` to `09_...R`.  
3. Open the scripts in that order and work through them along with the video. 

## Data
There is **no dataset** with these materials. The point of this workshop is to simulate data to 
understand experimental outcomes and design better experiments.
