## Instructions
1. Scripts are numbered from 1 to 9. 
2. Open the scripts in that order and work through them along with the video. 

## Data
There is **no dataset** with these materials. The point of this workshop is to simulate data to 
understand experimental outcomes and design better experiments.

## Resources
We lay out many of the ideas we cover in the workshop in this paper:
